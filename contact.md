Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites, but thereâ€™s no backend to send your data to.

However, one can use free SaaS as a backend for forms, such as [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to handle form submissions. 

This contect form is powered by Formspree. You can also try it on your own website.

### Feel free to contact me

Fill in the form or [email me](mailto:{{site.email}}) to discuss your problem.
